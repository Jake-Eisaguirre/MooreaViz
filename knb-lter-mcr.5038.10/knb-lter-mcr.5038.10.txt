      These data and analyses code were generated in support of the manuscript: Adam TC,

        Washburn L, and RJ Schmitt, Ecological Applications 
       We investigated the potential role of anthropogenic nutrient loading in driving recent
        coral-to-macroalgae phase shifts on reefs in the lagoons surrounding Moorea, French
        Polynesia. We used nitrogen (N) tissue content and stable isotopes (Î´15N) in an abundant
        macroalga (Turbinaria ornata) together with empirical models of nutrient discharge to
        describe spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient enrichment in the lagoons. 
        Turbinaria ornata were collected at 190 sites around Moorea in January, May, and August 2016. These
        sampling periods corresponded with distinct seasonal shifts in rainfall and wave forcing.
        Our results revealed that patterns of N enrichment were linked to rainfall, wave-driven
        circulation, and distance from anthropogenic nutrient sources, especially human sewage. In
        addition to describing high resolution patterns of N enrichment from 2016, we also analyzed
        core MCR time series on N tissue content in Turbinaria ornata from three habitats (fringing
        reef, back reef, and reef crest) at the six core MCR LTER sites between 2007 and 2013. These
        data showed that fringing reefs have been consistently enriched in N relative to back reefs,
        which are enriched relative to the reef crest. Further, these patterns mirror long-term
        patterns of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the water column. We also analyzed core
        MCR time series on benthic communities and fishes and found that back reef sites that were
        consistently enriched in N between 2007 and 2013 experienced large increases in macroalgae
        while macroalgae remained much less abundant at back reef sites with lower N. These phase
        shifts to macroalgae occurred despite island-wide increases in the density and biomass of
        herbivorous fishes over the time period. Together, these results indicate that nutrient
        loading may be an important driver of coral-to-macroalgae phase shifts in the lagoons of
        Moorea even though the reefs harbor an abundant and diverse herbivore assemblage,
        emphasizing the important role that bottom-up factors can play in driving
        coral-to-macroalgae phase shifts.

             To map N availability in the lagoons of Moorea we collected samples of Turbinaria ornata 
              (hereafter Turbinaria) at 190
              sites around Moorea during three different sampling periods, corresponding with different
              rainfall and wave regimes (January 2016, May 2016, and August 2016). Sites were spaced to
              maximize coverage of the different reef habitats within the lagoons, including the fringing
              reefs, mid-lagoon/back reef, reef crest, reef passes, and bays. Like other macroalgae,
              Turbinaria responds to N pulses by storing surplus N and consequently N tissue content is
              believed to be an excellent time-integrated indicator of N availability. Sampling was conducted
              over ~ 3 weeks during each of the three sampling periods; due to logistic constraints, some
              sites were not sampled in all three sampling periods (January n = 184, May n = 171, August n =
              173). At each of the sites, we collected thalli from 10 different patches of Turbinaria across
              an area of ~ 500 m2. Samples were immediately placed on ice and transported to the laboratory.
              One blade from each of 10 thalli was sampled at 5 cm below the apical tip. Blades were scrubbed
              of epiphytes and rinsed with fresh water before being dried at 60Â° C to a constant weight and
              ground to a fine powder. Total N content was determined via elemental analysis using a CHN
              Carlo-Erba elemental analyzer (NA1500) at the University of Georgia, Center for Applied Isotope
              Studies. We also conducted stable isotope analyses to quantify the ratio of 
              15N: 14N (expressed
              as Î´15N) in algal tissue. Isotopic analysis on dried and ground algal tissue was conducted using
              a Thermo Finnigan Delta-Plus Advantage isotope mass spectrometer with a Costech EAS elemental
              analyzer at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Marine Science Institute Analytical
              Laboratory.
            In order to link spatial patterns of N enrichment with delivery mechanisms, we
              obtained daily rainfall and wave data. Rainfall data were from a meteorological station in Faaa,
              Tahiti (Global Historical Climatology Network ID:FP000091938), ~ 15 km east of Moorea. Wave data
              were from MCR LTER core time series from physical oceanographic moored instruments 
              (knb-lter-mcr.30, knb-lter-mcr.31, and knb-lter-mcr.32). We
              also used data from MCR LTER core time series on CHN content in macroalgae (knb-lter-mcr.20) to
              investigate long-term patterns of N enrichment. In addition, we used MCR LTER core time series
              data on the population and community dynamics of benthic algae (knb-lter-mcr.8) to test whether
              community shifts from coral to macroalgae were associated with the long-term nutrient
              environment and/or differences in the biomass of herbivorous fishes (data on herbivorous fishes
              were from MCR LTER core time series: knb-lter-mcr.6).
